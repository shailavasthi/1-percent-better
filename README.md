### Customer Need
If you want to move forward in life, you have to know where you want to go. You can accomplish this by visualizing your ideal future, and setting long-term goals for yourself. This is a common practice, from less effective methods such as New Years resolutions, to more effective goal-setting techniques like SMART goals. But long term goals aren't enough to effect progress. You need to have an idea of what to do on a daily basis to achieve those goals. Making this connection properly is difficult. People often have an idea of what they want to accomplish, but don't do anything about it on a day to day basis, and as a result, never achieve anything. At the other end of the spectrum, people often fail to live up toambitious short term expectations for themselves, and give up on their goal entirely. We need a way to bridge the gap between macro-level goals and micro-level actions.

### How current solutions fail
Habit trackers: Habit trackers lack thought. Mindlessly checking boxes is no way to improve. You have to go through an iterative process of planning out your actions, acting, and reviewing those actions for strengths and weaknesses. This is how you not only get better over time, but get better at getting better over time. Habit trackers lack this level of depth. 

Journaling: Journaling is great for exploring long form thought, but it’s too easy to get sidetracked or become long winded. Not to mention privacy concerns: you can’t password protect a paper journal, and you might lose it. Journaling apps fix this problem, but they don’t fix the problem of lack of direction and focus. They also don’t allow you to specifically aggregate reviews and plans, batched by your goal so you can seamlessly perform a meta analysis of your progress when you want to. 

### How 1-percent-better fulfills that need.
1 Percent Better implements an iterative plan/review process that encourages deep thinking on the part of the user, and allows for seamless aggregation of daily entries for meta-analysis. 1 Percent Better is also private and convenient; your data is password protected, and the app is accessable from all of your devices. And it's free, with no micro transactions or pro plans like habit trackers or journaling apps (or paper journals, which you have to buy).
